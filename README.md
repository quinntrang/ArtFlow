# ArtFlow

## Description

Creating art is an explorative experience. Artists do not make art only to reach the end goal of how the art piece should look, but also to immerse themselves in the process of art creation. Often, artists do not know what the end piece looks like, but the journey they go on while making art reveals the next steps of the process.

ArtFlow serves as a platform for visual artists to record the progress of their artwork (WIP), allowing users to deepen the personal connection with their artistic journey.
